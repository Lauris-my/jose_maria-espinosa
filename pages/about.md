## About the Collection

This site is generated using [CollectionBuilder-GH](https://collectionbuilding.github.io/gh/), a project to create a free and simple digital collection using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) from: 

- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of JPG images or PDF documents

The template repository features ten objects from the Biblioteca Nacional de Colombia's [Fondo José María Espinosa](https://www.bibliotecanacional.gov.co/es-co/colecciones/grafica/publicacion/jos%C3%A9-mar%C3%ADa-espinosa-(1796-a-1883)).
